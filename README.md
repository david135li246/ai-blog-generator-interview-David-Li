```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/david135li246/ai-blog-generator-interview-David-Li.git
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```
   cd ai-blog-generator-interview-David-Li
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```

## Running the Application

To run the Flask application, execute the following command:
```
python src/app.py
```
The application will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Generating a Blog Post

You can generate a blog post by hitting the following endpoint:
```
GET /generate?keyword=<your_keyword>
```
Replace `<your_keyword>` with the desired keyword (e.g., `wireless earbuds`).

## Setting Up the Scheduler

The application includes a scheduler that can be configured to run daily. You can either use the APScheduler integrated in `src/scheduler.py` or set up a cron job.

### Using APScheduler

1. Ensure that the scheduler is started in `src/app.py`.
2. Modify the predefined keyword in `src/scheduler.py` as needed.

### Using Cron Job

Alternatively, you can create a shell script (`generate_daily.sh`) to hit the `/generate` endpoint and set up a cron job to run it daily.

## Example Output

An example of a generated blog post can be found in `example_wireless_earbuds.md`. This file showcases the structure and content of the output generated by the application.
